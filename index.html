    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Rohit, an enthusiastic MCA student with a strong foundation in HTML and a growing passion for artificial intelligence. I enjoy creating clean, responsive web pages and I'm currently focused on building my skills in web development while exploring the exciting world of AI.

      Though I'm just starting out, I’m eager to apply my knowledge in real-world environments and am actively looking for an internship opportunity where I can learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully.
      
      I'm always curious, always learning, and excited about the future of tech. Let’s connect and build something great together!
